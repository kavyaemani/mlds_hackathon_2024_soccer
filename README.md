# How to use our code
## Data Location
- All necessary data files can be downloaded from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11uGTK2-DmquGXKvqoUxr0KA8ZDj8-wpV/view?usp=sharing
- Note: Please ensure that the folder structure is not changed or the code will not run

## Virtual Environment Set Up
You will need to have python3 and anaconda installed. If these are not installed, please install them.

### Open Terminal and the commands below to install the correct packages to run our code
`conda create -n hackathon2024env`

`conda activate hackathon2024env`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Generate cleaned data
- Open `extract_data_from_pdfs.ipynb` and run all code chunks
- Open `extract_player_data.ipynb` and run all code chunks

## Run ML models
- Open and run (or run in terminal) `initial_lineup_generator.py`
- Open `Player_Substitution.ipynb` and run all code chunks

## Run AI Chat Bot
- Make sure you are in our directory.
- Get OpenAI API Key for GPT 4o-mini.
- Write this command: export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
- For now, use this temporary key: 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
